- CS151_Full_Stack_Project (Backend: Java, Frontend: Java Swing)
- Team Name: Gamers
- Team Members: Munkh-Erdene Khuderbaatar, John Phan, Nicholas Valencia
- IMPORTANT: This project is not 100% same as the one submitted by my teammates; I worked on top of the original group code, which was NOT MVC style and had less features     
  and more error prone; I turned it into MVC and added my own changes and security
- What I did: codeveloped the application, designed the application in the MVC design pattern style; added forgotPasswordButton, showUsersButton, show Password Visible  
  checkbox, and handled error-proneness (e.g. previously the app would allow to sign up without first and last name etc.); designed and drew Use Case and State UML Diagrams. 
- The application was written in JDK 17 and in Intellij
- Functionality: this application allows users checkout books, sign in, sign up, view books in the library, etc. It is very convenient to use. For instance, if a user forgets 
  the password/username, one can simply click on the show Users button and see it; additionally, one can retrieve the password by providing the security question answer;   
- Operations: patrons can checkout books, and librarians can both checkout books and add books; both can sign in and sign up; forgot Password 
  button asks for the username and the security question after which provides the password; shows Users button allows users see the current list of registered users and their 
  usernames and passwords for convenience in case a user forgets both the username and password
- Steps to run your code: please either run the Jar file directly, or download the java files and copy/paste them in your IDE; please make sure to create 3 packages and add 
  all relevant files to the proper packages. For instance, model package should only hold what is inside the model folder, etc. Please run the MVCLibraryApp class, which is 
  the main class to start the app. Thank you very much for your time.
